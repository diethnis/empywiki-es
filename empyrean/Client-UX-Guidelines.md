# Client UX Guidelines

This document is a continual work in progress, none of the following rules are hard and fast. If your client doesn't comply, we can promise that no sword-wielding ninja lawyers will hunt you down.

# Clients must/should
List of UX suggestions that clients really ought to follow

### Leverage relevant sharing APIs for the client's target platform
Enabling simpler ways to interface with your client can shave seconds off what would otherwise be a very repetitive and tedious workflow. Using Android's share functionality or adding a context menu option to Windows explorer.exe can vastly improve a user's experience

### Allow the user to manually specify an Empyrean server to use
Users should be able to enter arbitrary URLs upon which the client's API requests will be made. This allows users to use the same Empyrean apps on their own private servers as others can do with Empy.org

### Support both HTTP and HTTPS
Users should be able to select either HTTP or HTTPS to facilitate private server deployment

### Optional HTTPS cert verification
Verification of HTTPS certificates should be configurable, again to facilitate private server deployment for those who do not wish to forgo encryption

### Display file upload progress
Despite library support for this being patchy at best, its probably safe to say that if you intend your tool to be used by the general public then displaying file upload progress is a must

### Facilitate the creation of content to upload
There are plenty of temporary file storage sites around, but an opportunity that is opened up by the design of Empyrean and similar services is the streamlining of creating content and sharing it immediately. This is what Empyrean was really designed for. Clients can do this by eg implementing a screenshot feature or accepting text to upload as a new file. 

### Check providers.json for available public Empyrean servers
Clients may query https://empy.org/providers.json for a list of known public Empyrean servers and present this list to the user on setup

### Test whether a file may already exist on the user's account
You can use the information provided by the Empyrean API about a user's files to do some simple tests regarding the potential for a file to have been already uploaded. This doesn't have to be a particularly complicated or rigorous test, a simple filename match will do. If you think the file might already exist on the server, notifying the user via a warning or a prompt (eg `Continue/replace existing file/abort`) may just spare them having to manage file duplication

### On text file upload, return EmPaste link
If EmPaste is enabled on the Empyrean instance your client is connecting to, when text files are uploaded the response will have an additional attribute: `paste_url`. Since the EmPaste web interface does syntax highlighting, you may want to present this link to the user rather than the link to the plain text file.  
If you do implement this, you shouldn't rely on EmPaste being enabled; It is disabled by default.
