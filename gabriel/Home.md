Gabriel is the pure Javascript client for Empyrean hosted at [[https://empy.org/gabriel]].

Gabriel is currently in a state of near non-maintenance. Contributions are more than welcome!

Maintainer: [Bob131](https://github.com/Bob131)

## Deployment
Gabriel (on the `master` branch) should be pretty easy to set up; Clone the repo, amend the `api_url` line in `/static/main.js` to point to your API and serve. Bon Appétit!

If you wish to mirror the setup on [empy.org](https://empy.org/gabriel), the `gh-pages` branch includes some additional commits for user-customisable providers. If you do redeploy this code, be warned that the CORS configuation on `api.empy.org` will refuse requests from origins other than [empy.org](https://empy.org).
